Databases are pervasive in our current digital experience and applications.  Briefly discuss the history and current applications of database systems e.g., social media platforms, financial services, educational institutions, app development and other relevant areas.


PLAN:

Just go back through each source and make more than 1 point per source please jackson dont be stupid <3 
please work mate i dont know why its not. this better work

INTRO:

- Before computer databases, there was physical storage of paper files in cabinets and desks
    
- Discuss SQL and NOSQL 
    
- “the early 1960s marked the beginning of computerized databases.” (1)

(still do to some extent)  served as the backbone of the platform's data infrastructure, "As of April 13, the signs of progress recently have acted against over 30,000 fake accounts." (4) shows the need to go from MySQL to more evolved systemssupporting user profiles, friend connections, posts, comments, and other core features. | Targeted Ads: Makes use of databases , large source of revenue for social media services so evolution of systems makes importnant - Facebook (Apache Casandra NoSQL) stores demographic information, interests, and behaviors in databases for their targeted ads. Apache Hadoop/Kafka - H:storing and processing large datasets related to user behavior, engagement metrics, and ad performance. K: real-time data streaming and event processing. <br><br>"Facebook's current approach is to address account integrity focusing on the authenticity of the accounts and their behaviors."

“NoSQL databases are useful for unstructured data and saw growth in the 2000s, allowing for faster processing of larger,” (1)

  

Ingres, which was developed at UBC, System R, created at IBM San Jose. 

Relevant Areas: Business operations, financial services, educational institutions, scientific research, government agencies, and various other industries requiring structured data storage and retrieval.

"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks." - E.F Codd (3) “This paper marked the beginning of the relational database, which shows the relationship between different data records and is more space-efficient, making it cost-effective for data storage. This led to the creation of INGRES, a relational database model, at the University of California, Berkeley, which used the QUEL query language. IBM released its own re*+lational database, System R, which was the first to use Structured Query Language (SQL).” (1)

  

 +44 (0) 191 208 5812 - charles harvey phone number, maybe ring and ask if he’ll give me the source???????? Kinda scary but also highkey balling as fuck let me not lie

  

For dumbass robot: robot was too dumb . maybe not, they haven’t done great tbh

My apologies for the oversight. Yes, the prompt should be updated to ensure it reflects the expectations accurately. Here's the corrected prompt: Task: Databases are pervasive in our current digital experience and applications. Briefly discuss the history and current applications of database systems, e.g., social media platforms, financial services, educational institutions, app development, and other relevant areas. Ensure to give quotations from the text and explain their relevance to whatever points you come up with. 

Prompt: Please provide a comprehensive breakdown of the provided source text, focusing on key points related to the historical and current applications of database systems. Include references to specific areas such as social media platforms, financial services, educational institutions, app development, and any other relevant domains.

Intro: Starts by discussing the increase in popularity in “schema-flexible NoSQL data stores” e.g. MongoDB and how they allow for flexible changes to be made to database applications as they are being developed. 

The study analyses the source code of applications on GitHub, -> will give insight into how applications use NoSQL databases in the real world (current applications)

“We focus on the relevant software stack shown in Figure 1a, namely Java applications that use an object-NoSQL mapper to store data in either Google arXiv:2003.00054v1 [cs.DB] 28 Feb 2020 2 Scherzinger and Sidortschuck Cloud Datastore3 or MongoDB4, both popular and mature data stores. Among over 1.2K open source GitHub repositories with this stack,” - shows what the study is doing providing credibility with statistics.

The Source discusses the growth in complexity of NoSQL database schemas and how these database systems evolve over time.

The source confirms “common denormalization” in NoSQL database schemes, 

(Denormalization: the process of adding precomputed redundant data to an otherwise normalized relational database to improve the read performance of the database.) which has historical relevance as the adoption of denormalization in these databases shows the evolution away from traditional relational database practises. 

//common denormalization in NoSQL database schemas directly relates to the evolution of database systems by highlighting historical shifts in database design practices and providing insights into current trends and best practices in database system architecture. It demonstrates how database systems have evolved to meet the changing needs and priorities of developers and organizations over time.//chatgpt// 

“We are able to confirm that denormalization is common in NoSQL database schemas. We are further able to show evidence of evolutionary changes to the NoSQL database schema in all analyzed projects.”

Prelim: discusses Google Cloud Datastore and MongoDB, two popular NoSQL data stores, both schema-free, - “both manage document-like data”, emphasising the flexibility of NoSQL data stores in managing various types of data structures, E.g Facebook, banking systems and universities (all current, Social Media, Finance and Education relevance)

Discuss the evolution of NoSQL database schemas based on changes in entity-classes over time providing insight on how they have evolved and their adaption to their requirements changing in different application domains. e.g early social networking like Friendster and this links to the evolution seen in modern current cloud-based storage solutions. 

Twitter/X utilises denormalization practises (current)

Used in e-commerce historically through the early days of  (historical) - still used to help improve query performance by reducing the need for complex joins and minimizing data redundancy.
